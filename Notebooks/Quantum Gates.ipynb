After working through this notebook a user will have knowledge about quantum logic gates, how they operate on qubits, and how they are implemented in QISKit. Quantum logic gates (along with qubits) form all the needed components to create a quantum circuit."

If we have a 2-D column vector $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix}$ and a $ 2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22}\\end{bmatrix}$, we can multiply them together as follows:\n",
